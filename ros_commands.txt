#  ================================Old Running Waiter ====================================
# To Run the waiter:  

1. Turn on the redis server (both robots need to make and publish q so this should always be done first)  

1.1: clear the queue if you want to start with an empty queue between runs (Usally you want this) 
redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 DEL shared_orderQ 

1.2: Start the sever at localhost (from waiter robot) at port 6400 
redis-server --port 6400 --protected-mode no  

2. Run the following ros launch files 
2.1: for general ros and movement: 
ros2 launch stretch_core stretch_driver.launch.py   

2.2: for the respeaker (speech and mic)  
*If on blinkey you may need to rebuild and source (for every new terminal too): 
    cd ~/ament_ws
    colcon build 
    source ~/ament_ws/install/setup.bash

ros2 launch respeaker_ros2 respeaker.launch.py  

3. Run the node 
python3 WaiterNode 

Notes: run 1 - 2 from home dir, run WaiterNode from 
coffeebot/coffee_ws/src
